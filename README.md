## Private Assignments

The assignments have been developed from scratch using custom libraries. They are currently implemented in:

- **Java**
- **C++**

*(Implementations in Kotlin, Swift, Python, and WASM are in progress.)*

Each assignment is organized into its respective folder under the `assignments` directory:

- **Week 1:**
  - Hello World
  - Percolation
- **Week 2:**
  - Randomized Queue
- **Week 3:**
  - Collinear Points
- **Week 4:**
  - 8 Puzzle
- **Week 5:**
  - K-D Tree

**Note:** Due to the Honor Code, these assignments are not publicly released and are maintained in a separate private repository.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

In addition to the assignments, this repository includes implementations of key data structures and algorithms across four different languages. *(Python implementations are pending.)* For more details, please visit the respective repositories for each language.
