# Algorithms by Professor Sedgewick

Algorithms by Professor Sedgewick
Every two modules in this course represents one week of course work.

## Assignments (Private)

All the assignements are implemented from ground up using my own libraries currently in two different languages.
Java, C++. (Kotlin, Swift, Python and WASM are in TODO state)

All implementations lay in their own respective folders under assignments.

* Week 1:
  * Hello World
  * Percolation
* Week 2:
  * Randomized Queue
* Week 3:
  * Collinear Points
* Week 4:
  * 8 Puzzle
* Week 5:
  * K-D Tree

Assingments are not published due to Honor Code and are located in a separate private repo.

## Datastructures and Algorithms

All the primary datastructures and algorithms have been implemented using four different languages and they lay inside their respective folder. (Python is in TODO state.)
One can browse to the respective repos of these implementations for more details.

## Usage Rights

I am publishing these in the spirit of free education. Please do not use this code in implementation of your solutions for any course or professional work. Instead hopefully you can find some inspiration here to implement your own solutions. In case you have any questions or suggestions please do not hesitate to contact me.
