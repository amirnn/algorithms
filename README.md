# Algorithms by Professor Sedgewick

Algorithms by Professor Sedgewick
Every two modules in this course represents one week of course work.

## Assignments

All the assignements are implemented from ground up using my own libraries currently in two different languages.
Java, C++. (Kotlin, Swift, Python and WASM are in TODO state)

All implementations lay in their own respective folders under assignments.

* Week 1:
  * Hello World
  * Percolation
* Week 2:
  * Randomized Queue
* Week 3:
  * Collinear Points
* Week 4:
  * 8 Puzzle
* Week 5:
  * K-D Tree

## Datastructures and Algorithms

All the primary datastructures and algorithms have been implemented using four different languages and they lay inside their respective folder. (Python is in TODO state.)
One can browse to the respective repos of these implementations for more details.
